 global_culture.0002.desc:0 "Long ago, our ancestors migrated to the Iberian peninsula and built their first settlements. We have lived here for generations since then, the land shaping us as much as we have shaped the land.\n\nIt is time to ask ourselves, are we still Visigoths? Or are we something new entirely?"
 global_culture.0002.a:0 "Czasy się zmieniają, a my musimy zmieniać się z nimi."

 global_culture.0005.desc:0 "When the Visigoths first migrated into the Iberian peninsula, they were foreigners in a new and strange land.\n\nThis changed over many generations, as land shaped them as much as they shaped the land itself. Over time the various communities of Visigoths grew distinct and separate from one another.\n\nDespite their shared heritage these new communities — [castilian.GetName], [catalan.GetName], [occitan.GetName], and [andalusian.GetName] — no longer recognize each other as kin."

 global_culture.0012.desc:0 "Living in the harsh lands of Scandinavia, our people have a history of ensuring our prosperity and survival though trading, pillaging, and fighting as swords for hire.\n\nOver time this resulted in the accumulation of great wealth, making our people put down roots and settle in permanent homesteads with greater frequency.\n\nNow these settlements have begun to diverge from each other culturally, as their traditions and even languages change to meet the demands of their new lifestyles."

 global_culture.0015.desc:0 "Traders, raiders, and mercenaries... the Norse have long traveled from Scandinavia all throughout Europe and even beyond, leaving their mark everywhere they went.\n\nNow it appears that this age may be coming to an end, as cultural differences and clan rivalries have led to the rise of disparate [danish.GetName], [swedish.GetName], and [norwegian.GetName] identities amongst them."

 global_culture.0022.desc:0 "Under pressure from the Huns, our ancestors first migrated into Hispania around 500 years ago and founded their own kingdom.

As the leader of my people, it is my responsibility to ensure future prosperity and if we are to flourish, then we must adapt to our new environment. We must learn from the people whose ancestors made use of these fertile grounds.\n\nBy this decree, we will change our way of life to benefit our kin. We will forge a new path as our own people."
