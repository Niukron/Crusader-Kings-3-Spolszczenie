 dungeon_ongoing.0004.desc:0 "I thought the wound was almost healed, but now it has started burning. I cannot look at it properly in the dark, but it feels bulbous to the touch.\n\nI cannot tell if the moistness accompanying the searing pain is blood, pus, or condensation from the dank air."

 dungeon_ongoing.0009.desc:0 "I do not know how I would have survived down here without the comfort that my dear [ROOT.Char.Custom('prison_pet')] provides.\n\nWhenever I feel sad it is there to comfort me, whenever I feel like giving up it urges me on.

 dungeon_ongoing.9001.t:0 "W zasięgu"
 dungeon_ongoing.9001.desc:0 "I do not recall the last time I saw the sun. I do not recall the last time I had solid food, or solid anything else. It feels like the dampness in the air has fastened itself in my lungs. If a tooth hurts, I simply pull it out of my rotting gums."
 dungeon_ongoing.9001.a:0 "It is so hard to move."
 dungeon_ongoing.9002.t:0 "Hollow"
 dungeon_ongoing.9002.desc:0 "The coughing never ends. It has been days, and I have not had an hour's sleep without waking with my hands clawing at my throat. Licking trickles of water off the wall does nothing anymore."

 dungeon_ongoing.9003.t:0 "Recollection"
 dungeon_ongoing.9003.desc:0 "Will I ever be let out of here? Am I simply locked up, abandoned and forgotten? Does anyone but the gaoler know I am here? Is there anyone left who knows my name? Who knows who I was?"
 dungeon_ongoing.9003.a:0 "I can barely recall their faces..."
 dungeon_ongoing.9004.t:0 "Abandonment"
 dungeon_ongoing.9004.desc:0 "I will die here. I know it for certain. I will never again feel the sun on my face, or hear laughter not tinged with an edge of hopelessness."

 dungeon_ongoing.9005.t:0 "Unfathomable Loss"
 dungeon_ongoing.9005.desc:0 "My faithful companion, my most treasured friend, my lifeline in this dark place...\n\nAs I cradle my dying [ROOT.Char.Custom('prison_pet')] in my arms I am overcome with the hopelessness of my situation.

 dungeon_ongoing.9005.a:0 "You cannot leave me here alone!"
