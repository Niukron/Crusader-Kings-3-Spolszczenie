 court.2201.desc:0 ""-belongs to me! Dividing [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier] up between separate heirs makes no sense!" cries [eldest_heir.GetFirstName] as [eldest_heir.GetSheHe] and [younger_heir.Custom2('HerHisCharacterIntroduction', eldest_heir)] bicker loudly at the other end of the room. "We're dooming the realm to murder and civil war. [ROOT.Char.GetMotherFather|U] should leave all [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] lands to #EMP me#!!"\n\n"Murder? Civil war? Exactly #EMP what#! do you have planned for when you're [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]?" snorts [younger_heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip].

 court.2411.t:0 "Labyrinthine Halls"
 court.2411.desc:0 "My stroll takes me through a disused wing of the palace, touring some capacious (if dusty) quarters that my over-worked staff seldom visit, when I hear a phlegmy sobbing coming from a by-passage.\n\nInvestigating, I find [lost_guest.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)], collapsed in despair.
