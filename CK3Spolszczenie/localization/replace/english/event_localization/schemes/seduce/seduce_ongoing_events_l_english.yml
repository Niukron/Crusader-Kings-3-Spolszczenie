 seduce_ongoing.7102.desc:0 "I try to create an opportunity for a private moment with [target.GetTitledFirstName], but the mood for romance doesn't come naturally with [target.GetHerHim]. Even with my lack of success, I decided to go for it, despite the atmosphere not being perfect. I lean in closer so that I can whisper sweet nothings into [target.GetHerHis] ear, but before I can say anything, [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] recoils as if burned by something and stalks off.\n\nI'm uncertain if that reaction is due to inexperience, disgust, or bashfulness. However, I do know that things could've gone better."

 seduce_ongoing.7201.desc:0 ""I'd like to get to know you better."\n[target.GetTitledFirstName] appears tense at first, but relaxes over time as [target.GetSheHe] starts to believe there's no ulterior motive behind my request.\n\nBefore we part, I thank [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] for the lovely time and [target.GetSheHe] tries to return my smile with a wobbly one of [target.GetHerHis] own. While the time spent is hardly one for the books, there's no denying that I've never seen [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] smile this much in one day. I am certain that [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] will be thinking of me for a long time."
 seduce_ongoing.7202.desc:0 "Getting a moment alone with [target.GetTitledFirstName] wasn't difficult. However, it turns out that the challenging part is having a normal conversation with [target.GetHerHim]. I ask [target.GetHerHim] a question and [target.GetSheHe] replies with the shortest answer [target.GetSheHe] can think of just to shut down our conversation. It's like pulling an endless amount of teeth! \n\nI can't stop thinking that I would get more of a response from a dead [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] than from [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
