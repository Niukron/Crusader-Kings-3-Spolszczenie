 prison.1001.start.desc:0 "My daydream comes to an abrupt end when the cell door is thrown open. The guard's silhouette is familiar, but the [actor.GetWomanMan] behind him... Oh. Oh no.\n\n"
 prison.1001.rack.desc:0 "[actor.GetTitledFirstName] straps me to the rack [actor.GetHerselfHimself], a pleased smirk on [actor.GetHerHis] lips. "I trust you have heard the others. The screams, the snapping of bones and sinews."
 prison.1001.whip.desc:0 "[actor.GetTitledFirstName] twirls the whip in [actor.GetHerHis] hand.  "Oh, the whip looks innocent enough, but it can separate flesh from bones just as well as any knife."
 prison.1001.rats.desc:0 ""These rats might seem docile," [actor.GetTitledFirstName] says, gesturing towards a faintly squeaking bucket. "But if they smell fire, they will happily gnaw their way through #emp anything#! to escape."

 prison.1001.a:0 "I will tell you everything, I swear!"
 prison.1001.b:0 "..."
 prison.1002.rack.desc:0 "Why complicate matters? There is nothing like the good old rack. When the jailer hauls [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] into the room, [recipient.GetHerHis] eyes are immediately drawn to the big wooden frame."
 prison.1002.whip.desc:0 "Oh, the sweet kiss of the whip! It might look innocent, but it can separate flesh from bones just as well as any knife. Judging by the look on [recipient.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] face, [recipient.GetSheHe] knows this all too well."
 prison.1002.rats.desc:0 "The rats in the bucket might seem shy at first, but they will happily gnaw their way through a [`recipient.GetWomanMan]'s chest once some heat is added. As I explain the concept to [recipient.GetTitledFirstName], [recipient.GetHerHis] resolve melts away before my eyes."

 prison.1003.t:0 "Torturuj"
 prison.1003.rack.desc:0 "Why complicate matters? There is nothing like the good old rack. The sound when bones and sinews snap is quite unforgettable. But not as unforgettable as the pain [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] is soon to experience..."
 prison.1003.whip.desc:0 "Oh, the sweet kiss of the whip! It might look innocent, but it can separate flesh from bones just as well as any knife — a truth [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] is soon to experience.

 prison.1003.rats.desc:0 ""These rats might seem shy," I say as I strap the bucket to [recipient.GetFirstNamePossessive] exposed chest.

 prison.1020.t:0 "Blinded"
 prison.1020.start.desc:0 "The jailer drags a panicked [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] into the room. "Please! I will do anything, anything you want!" [recipient.GetHerHis|U] protests are cut short as the jailor gags [recipient.GetHerHim] and ties [recipient.GetHerHim] down on the table.\n\n"
 prison.1020.cruel.desc:0 ""Oh, [recipient.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]," I sigh theatrically. "You and I never quite saw eye to eye. But on the bright side, I have finally decided how to rectify the situation.""
 prison.1020.compassionate.desc:0 ""This might seem barbaric," I say as the physician prepares [physician.GetHerHis] tools, "but this is for the stability of the realm. Trust me — I take no pleasure in your suffering.""
 prison.1020.child.desc:0 ""This will make everything feel better," the physician says as [physician.GetSheHe] offers [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] the sedating draught. [recipient.GetHerHis|U] little hand is shaking, but [recipient.GetSheHe] drinks it all the same.\n\nOnce the [recipient.Custom('GirlBoy')] is asleep, the physician gives me a long look. "Are you sure about this, my [actor.GetLadyLord]?""
 prison.1020.a:0 "Oh, yes, this #emp will#! hurt."
 prison.1020.b:0 "I have my reasons."
 prison.1021.start.desc:0 "I am quietly contemplating my fate when the jailor suddenly slams the door open and drags me out of the cell. There, in the gloomy corridor, [actor.GetTitledFirstName] awaits.\n\n"
 prison.1021.cruel.desc:0 "The pleased look on [actor.GetHerHis] face sends a shiver up my spine.\n\n"Do not fret. I have not come for your head — your eyes will do just fine.""
 prison.1021.compassionate.desc:0 ""[recipient.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], I want you to know I take no pleasure in this. I am forced to blind you. For the stability of the realm.""
 prison.1021.child.desc:0 ""It will make everything feel better," the physician says as [physician.GetSheHe] offers me a tiny glass bottle. This is a bad place, with bad people, but [physician.GetHerHis] eyes... they are nice. With a shaking hand, I lift the bottle to my lips."
 prison.1021.a:0 "My... my eyes? Let me go! #emp Nooo!#!"
 prison.1021.b:0 "I... I feel strange..."
 prison.1025.t:0 "Castrated"

 prison.9001.t:0 "Freedom!"
 prison.9001.desc_1:0 "I spend many days planning my escape, thinking about the best course of action and route of escape. It all amounts to nothing though as one day the guard simply forgets to lock the door, staggering away without looking back."
 prison.9001.desc_2:0 "A nice word here, a heartfelt compliment there – soon the guard views me with warm familiarity instead of the initial suspicion [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] harbored. When I ask for a bit of fresh air [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] does not even question me, and I leave [dummy_gender.GetHerHim] face down in a ditch."
 prison.9001.desc_3_opening:0 "A moments distraction, that was all I needed to slip the keyring from the guard's belt and behind my back."
 prison.9001.desc_3_house_arrest:0 "When darkness falls I slowly ease my door open, wincing at the screech."
 prison.9001.desc_3:0 "When darkness falls I make my way slowly out of my cell, wincing at the screech."
 prison.9001.desc_4:0 "I scour every inch of the cell. I inspect every hinge, feel along every bar, and investigate every stone. As darkness once again falls I finally find what I've been looking for – a loose stone! It is quick work to widen the hole into a tunnel after that."
 prison.9001.desc_5:0 "I stalk the corridors, every door as familiar as an old friend, and I bide my time. I know who goes where, and at what time. I know who calls upon specific servants, and I know the fastest route out of the [imprisoner.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')]. As darkness falls I simply wait for the perfect moment, and then I slip away like a shadow."
 prison.9001.desc_6:0 "I wait until darkness falls, and as soon as I am certain no one is around I grab one bar in each hand and #EMP bend#!. Sweat drips into my eyes, and my panting breath echoes in the darkness, but soon I have a hole just big enough to squeeze through."
 prison.9001.desc_7:0 "As soon as the guard leave I descend upon the lock. It's old and rusty, and all I have to work with is a small nail I found in the corner, but that will not stop me. A small twist, a tiny nudge, and– #EMP there!#!"
 prison.9001.desc_8:0 "I smile as the guard tries to stifle a yawn. I have kept the discussion going for hours by now, and I dive into the topic of [ROOT.Char.Custom('subject_of_interest')] without relenting. Soon [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is nodding in [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] chair, and then it's a simple thing to get the keys of [dummy_gender.GetHerHim]."
 prison.9001.desc_9:0 "Many days of sly gazes, insinuating gestures, and invitations have finally born fruit, and as the guard approach me with one hand already unlacing [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] [dummy_gender.Custom('GetUpperClothingArticle')] I smile. It is a painless thing, to pass out in the throes of bliss, and I make sure to cause no undue harm."
 prison.9001.desc_ending_1:0 "\n\nAs I disappear into the [imprisoner.Custom('TerrainType')] surrounding [imprisoner.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] [imprisoner.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')] I finally dare to hope."

 prison.9001.a:0 "I am free!"
 prison.9002.desc_opening:0 "All I need is one moment of flagging attention"
 prison.9002.desc_rat:0 " – I release my rat who quietly makes its way across the floor, up the stool the guard is resting on, and right to the keys"
 prison.9002.desc_stone:0 " – I sneak up behind the guard and #EMP smash#! my stone into the back of [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] helmet. As the guard tumble to the ground I quickly search [dummy_gender.GetHerHim] for the keys"
 prison.9002.desc_spoon:0 " and I jab my spoon into the lock. After much wiggling and bending the lock gives with an audible #EMP click#!"
 prison.9002.desc_cockroach:0 " – I release my cockroach, and as it scurries under the guard's feet [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] jerks back violently enough to bash [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] skull against the wall"
 prison.9002.desc_end:0 ", and soon both me and my trusted [ROOT.Char.Custom('prison_pet')] are disappearing into the [imprisoner.Custom('TerrainType')] surrounding [imprisoner.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] [imprisoner.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')]."
 prison.9002.a:0 "We are free, [ROOT.Char.Custom('prison_pet')]!"
 prison.9003.desc:0 "As soon as [imprisoner.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] guards turn their backs to me and my fellow prisoner, [prison_friend.GetTitledFirstName], we strike.\n\nMy many day imprisoned has left me weak though, and as the guard slams a iron-clad fists into my stomach I quickly find myself overwhelmed and pinned. The guard prepares the finishing blow, but I see [prison_friend.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] looming above us, holding the guard's own knife – soon enough we are on the move again.\n\nAs we make our way out into the night, leaning on each other, we laugh."

 prison.9501.t:0 "Unbreakable Chains"
 prison.9501.desc:0 "As the guard is momentarily distracted I reach for the keyring hanging on the guard's belt, but a firm hand stops me halfway.\n\n"Oh no no. There's no escaping here, #EMP my [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]#!." The guard sneers down at me and laughs.\n\n"You thought the gruel you were getting was bad? Just you wait.""

 prison.9502.desc_opening:0 "As the guard turns around I quickly reach for my [ROOT.Char.Custom('prison_pet')] and hurl it at [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] head."
 prison.9502.desc_rat:0 "It scrambles, trying to find purchase, but the guard quickly reach up and throws it on the floor. My screams of protest are almost drowned out by the agonized squealing as the guard mercilessly grinds [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] heel down."
 prison.9502.desc_stone:0 "It bounces heavily off the guards helmet, but [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] only turns around with eyebrows raised in surprise. Spotting the stone [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] throws it out the window with a sneer."
 prison.9502.desc_spoon:0 "It bounces off the guards helmet, and [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] barely seems to notice. Turning around and spotting the out of place spoon, [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] picks it up and stuffs it into [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] own belt."
 prison.9502.desc_cockroach:0 "It scrambles for purchase, but the movement must have alerted the guard for [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] hand comes up and mercilessly swat my beloved cockroach to the ground, stomping it into the ground with a disgusted sneer."
