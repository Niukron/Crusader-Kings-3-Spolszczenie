 middle_east_decisions.0001.desc:0 "Od czasów Mahometa islam był siłą, z którą należało się liczyć na całym wschodzie i zagrożeniem dla wyznawców Chrystusa. Jednak dzięki moim wysiłkom na rzecz zabezpieczenia Ziemi Świętej, już tak nie jest.\n\nUdało mi się wypędzić niewiernych znad wybrzeży Morza Śródziemnego i przegonić ich z powrotem na palące pustynie Arabii. Udało nam się wznieść święty krzyż naszego Pana od morza do morza i stworzyć prawdziwe Imperium Niebieskie na strzaskanym półksiężycu fałszywego proroka."

[scoped_ruler.GetSheHe|U] has planted the holy cross of Our Lord from sea to sea, and forged a true Empire of Heaven over the broken Crescent of the false Prophet."
