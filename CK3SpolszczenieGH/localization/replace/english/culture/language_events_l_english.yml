 language_events.0001.desc:0 "It's hard keeping all of these languages in my head, I keep forgetting which language I am speaking!\n\nJust the other day, I accidentally introduced myself using a confusing mixture of [language_to_forget.GetLanguage.GetNameNoTooltip] and [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetNameNoTooltip] words... and I did not even realize I had done so until it was pointed out to me!\n\nPerhaps I should simply let [language_to_forget.GetLanguage.GetNameNoTooltip] slip from my mind..?"
 language_events.0001.a:0 "Let it slip into oblivion..."
 language_events.0001.b:0 "No! I must work harder, and study more!"
 language_events.0002.b.tt:0 "You send collectors to 'tax' [gold_i]#P 50#! from every [vassal_speaking_other_language.GetCulture.GetName] county in [vassal_speaking_other_language.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] realm"

 language_events.0002.desc:0 "It has reached my ears that my vassal, [vassal_speaking_other_language.GetTitledFirstName], is publicly lauding my proficiency in speaking [vassal_speaking_other_language.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetName] — the language spoken by [vassal_speaking_other_language.GetHerHis] own subjects!\n\nMy advisors suggest that I capitalize on this opportunity by sending a letter in [vassal_speaking_other_language.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetNameNoTooltip] to [vassal_speaking_other_language.GetHerHim], recognizing [vassal_speaking_other_language.GetHerHis] actions."
 language_events.0002.a:0 ""With greater understanding comes shared prosperity!""
 language_events.0002.b:0 ""Oh-ho ho! Now I can tax you more effectively, dear vassal.""

 language_events.0010.desc:0 "I wake up in a sweat after a grueling nightmare, where an owl was constantly following me and testing my knowledge in the [language_to_forget.GetLanguage.GetNameNoTooltip] language.\n\nA symbol of wisdom in some cultures, the feathered fiend was stalking me throughout the night, and I dreaded disappointing it. Perhaps there is such a thing as "too much knowledge" and this dream is a result of all the stress I feel in keeping my skills sharp."
 language_events.0010.a:0 "This cannot go on."
 language_events.0010.b:0 "I will continue to push myself daily!"
