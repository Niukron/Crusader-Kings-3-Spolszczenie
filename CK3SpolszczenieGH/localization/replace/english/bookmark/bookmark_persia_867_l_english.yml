 bm_867_persia_desc:0 "Two hundred years have passed since the Rashidun Caliphate conquered Persia, absorbing the vast plateau into the mighty Arabic Empire.\n\nTwo hundred years of servitude — yet all things turn in time.\n\nNow the Lords of Arabia wane, whilst Persia's ancient nobility wax stronger and fuller than they have in centuries, flourishing amidst the shattering of the once-almighty united Islamic Ummah.\n\nTo the west, the Abbasid Caliphate controls only the heartlands of the former Rashidun empire, their great governors from Iberia to India independent in all but name, the succession embroiled in an anarchic mess of betrayal, murder, and rebellion.\n\nTo the east, Islamic adventurers and sell-swords cut off by the Hindu Kush eye the spoils of Rajastan and Delhi greedily.\n\nPersia finds itself at a crossroads. Those loyal to the Caliph clash with the remaining followers of Zoroastrianism and Buddhism, ambitious warlords squabble with mountain chieftains, and Turkic mercenaries spar with Arabic invaders.\n\n#Bold The world turns: where will it take #Italic you?#!"

On the home front, the same commanders that supported Ya'qub's usurpation whisper of changing their loyalties yet again.\n\n#bold You seem poised to forge a new destiny for Persia — do you dare challenge the enduring might of the Abbasids?#!"

The sundering of the Caliphate shattered that central authority, leaving the Samanids to squabble amongst themselves for rule.\n\nYoung Ismail's chance to vie for power comes as he is welcomed as ruler of Bukhara, recently sacked by the armies of the fierce western Khwarezmshahs. Despite his prodigious talents, the rest of his family expect complete, loyal submission.\n\n#bold Can you surpass your brothers and restore the glory of Persia?"

Even now, his health begins to wane.\n\n#bold Will you spend your twilight years supporting your beleaguered nephew, the Amir of Khorasan, or focus on redeeming your family in the eyes of the caliph?#!"
