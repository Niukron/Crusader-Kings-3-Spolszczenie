 fp2_yearly.4004.desc:0 "I'm on my way through my courtroom when a scuffle at its far end draws my attention. A strapping [mozarab_wanderer.GetWomanMan] is being advanced upon by my guards, only for their weapons to clatter to the floor in the blink of an eye. The stranger flourishes [mozarab_wanderer.GetHerHis] sword in salute towards me.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]", [mozarab_wanderer.GetSheHe] begins as I wave away more guards, "I find myself without a liege to serve, and judging from your protection here you could do with my help."\n\nFrom the cross [mozarab_wanderer.GetSheHe] wears around [mozarab_wanderer.GetHerHis] neck, I deduce [mozarab_wanderer.GetSheHe] is a [mozarab_wanderer.GetFaith.GetAdherentName]."
 fp2_yearly.4004.a:0 "For a [mozarab_wanderer.GetWomanMan] of your talents? Absolutely!"
 fp2_yearly.4004.b:0 "I would rather my $knight_culture_player_no_tooltip_lowercase$s be [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNameNoTooltip]."

 fp2_yearly.4005.desc:0 "It is unusual, then, to see one of their local merchants ask for an audience with me.\n\n"We [mozarab_merchant.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural] tend to deal with a certain degree of extra... difficulty when living our lives." [mozarab_merchant.GetSheHe|U] speaks evenly and without rancor, but there's clearly some steel to [mozarab_merchant.GetHerHis] words.\n\n"All we want is for a small section of the cities in the [mozarab_quarter.GetName] to call our own and live among our people. I have come here to petition you, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], to see whether you might magnanimously grant us this.""

I note the crucifix looped around [mozarab_priest.GetHerHis] neck with some suspicion as [mozarab_priest.GetSheHe] begins to speak.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I only ask a minute of your time. All I want is for my flock to be able to worship in a [mozarab_priest.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] as all good followers of [mozarab_priest.GetFaith.HighGodName] should!" The nervous priest stops, and looks at me imploringly.\n\nLetting the [mozarab_priest.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural] build places of worship would make converting them trickier, but perhaps some leniency might aid the cohesiveness of my realm?"
 fp2_yearly.4006.a:0 "You have my assent. Build your [mozarab_priest.GetFaith.HouseOfWorshipPlural]."
 fp2_yearly.4006.b:0 "You will #EMP never #!build those heathen's shacks on my land!"
