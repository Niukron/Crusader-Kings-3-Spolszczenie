 court.3010.desc.lustful:0 "Every sentence describing a woman is excruciatingly descriptive and always features words like bouncing or jiggling. But it's not just the women, but the men too. However, their descriptions focus on their bulging muscles and chiseled chins."
 court.3010.desc.adventurer_or_pilgrim:0 "The focus is on vast, scenic landscapes and how it changes with the increased distance from home. There's some passages about wanderlust and homesickness as well, clearly the experiences of the writer."
 court.3010.desc.sadistic:0 "The violence described exceeds most people's tolerance for gore and obscenities. It paints a bloody scene red, with knights wading in blood up to their knees."
