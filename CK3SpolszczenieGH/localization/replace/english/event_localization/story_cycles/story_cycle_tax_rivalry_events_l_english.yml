 tax_rivalry.0011.desc_intro:0 "[forgiven_rival.GetTitledFirstName|U] has long been a silver thorn in my side, but perhaps it does not always have to be this way."
 tax_rivalry.0011.desc_opinion:0 "We are hardly on bad terms at all, and with a little due diligence might even become valuable allies of one another if only we end this feud."
 tax_rivalry.0011.desc_compassion:0 "I'm certainly not one to quarrel for extended periods, but can I trust [forgiven_rival.GetHerHim] to be as open-minded as I am?"
 tax_rivalry.0011.desc_unity:0 "For the good of the clan, I might make amends with [forgiven_rival.GetHerHim], if only in our public lives. But will [forgiven_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] feel the same way?"
 tax_rivalry.0011.desc_fallback:0 "I can reach out to [forgiven_rival.GetHerHim] to make amends, but who knows whether [forgiven_rival.GetSheHe] will accept my olive branch?"

 tax_rivalry.0012.desc_intro_unfriendly:0 "While I normally spurn any mention of [forgiving_rival.GetTitledFirstName] a certain mood possessed me to accept [forgiving_rival.GetHerHis] sudden visit to my courtyard."
 tax_rivalry.0012.desc_intro_friendly:0 "While [forgiving_rival.GetTitledFirstName] and I have not been close ever since our disputes began, still I appreciated [forgiving_rival.GetHerHis] sudden visit to my courtyard."
 tax_rivalry.0012.desc_outro:0 "There we dined in unseasonably pleasant weather until [forgiving_rival.GetSheHe] cleared [forgiving_rival.GetHerHis] throat:\n\n"Were we not engaged in this dispute, then we might enjoy many more afternoons like this.

 tax_rivalry.0013.a:0 "One can only hope."
 tax_rivalry.0014.desc:0 "It seems that, for the good of the realm, [forgiven_rival.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] and [forgiving_rival.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] have put their petty dispute aside. Only time will tell, though, whether spare embers might light this fire once more."
 tax_rivalry.0014.a:0 "We shall see."

 tax_rivalry.1000.desc:0 "[steward.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive|U] and [tax_collector.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] quarrels have proven injurious to the realm's finances. Neither wishes to correspond with the other, and as a result payments are often overridden, misplaced, and even lost.\n\nAs I grumble over this, I spy the pair's own contributions to the realm. How easy it would be to "lose" this sum and have each blame the other for its disappearance..."
 tax_rivalry.1000.b:0 "I should scold them for this oversight."
 tax_rivalry.1000.b.tt:0 "I order [steward.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] and [tax_collector.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] to cease their rivalry."

 tax_rivalry.1001.a:0 "That [other_rival.Custom('InsultNoun')]!"
 tax_rivalry.1002.desc:0 ""You two are becoming sloppy," [liege.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] pushes a bag of gold towards our end of the table.

 tax_rivalry.3001.desc_intro:0 "As I brood over my grievances with [sabotaged_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], a dastardly plan occurs to me.

 tax_rivalry.3002.a:0 "It was all [saboteur.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] doing!"
 tax_rivalry.3003.desc:0 "Oh the buffoonery... now the [sabotaged_county.GetName] has formed a rabble against my name, all because they believed [sabotaged_rival.GetTitledFirstName] would increase their taxes!\n\n[sabotaged_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip|U] is claiming that this is the work of [saboteur.GetTitledFirstName], but one thing is clear: the pair's rivalry is quickly spiraling out of control."
