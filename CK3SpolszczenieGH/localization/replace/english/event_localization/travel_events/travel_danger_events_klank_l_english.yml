 travel_danger_events.3000.desc.first_time:0 "One foot after another, I slowly move forward on a narrow mountain trail. Suddenly, I hear a rumble and a quickly silenced scream.\n\nShocked by the commotion, I whip around. Instead of [fallen_victim.GetFirstName] walking behind me, there is only an equally befuddled and tired face of [char_next_in_line.GetFirstName] standing in front of freshly turned rocks.\n\n"Where is [fallen_victim.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]?" I demand to know, my voice barely escaping my dry mouth.\n\nThe only response is a faint whistling of the wind."
 travel_danger_events.3000.desc.second_time:0 "I walk on the seemingly neverending, narrow mountain trail. I feel the veil of fatigue clouding my mind. I hear deceiving whispers from half-forgotten memories and a faintly whistling wind.\n\nBut there is something very much real about the piercing scream of [fallen_victim.GetFirstName]. With chills marching up my spine, I slowly turn around, and once again, I see a human-sized gap in our marching order.\n\n"Did we... Just... Lose another person?" I utter slowly. [char_next_in_line.GetFirstName] does not need to speak. [char_next_in_line.GetHerHis|U] face frozen in terror is enough of an answer."
 travel_danger_events.3000.a.first_time:0 "Watch where you step! We must press forward."

 travel_danger_events.3001.desc:0 "After a long and arduous journey among the snowy mountain peaks, I slowly warm myself next to the roaring fire in the local inn while [first_avalanche_victim.GetFirstName] and [second_avalanche_victim.GetFirstName] tend to our caravan outside. Suddenly, there is a distant yet powerful, deep, and reverberating thud.\n\n"Avalanche!" someone yells. Before anyone inside gets a chance to react, the sound gets louder and louder until it crescendos with a great force shaking the walls and the floor. After a heartbeat or an eternity, there is even more dreadful silence."

 travel_danger_events.3003.desc:0 "It has been snowing for days now. The road ahead appears completely impassable. However, as I look ahead, I see a small group of people approaching us fast across the snowdrifts.

 travel_danger_events.3004.desc:0 ""White Squall! Turn to port!"\n\nThe coxswain's horrifying yell does not suit the calm weather. But my ears are filled with an increasingly louder roar of the wind. In less than a heartbeat, the moist white mist that engulfs the whole ship. Louder then the wind, the main mast cracks and falls overboard.\n\nAnd as sudden as it came, the squall moves on. Our boat lazily rocks on the calm sea, dragging the torn sails and broken oars along."
 travel_danger_events.3004.a:0 "We need to somehow raise makeshift sails!"

 travel_danger_events.3005.desc:0 "We are walking among the hills late in the day. The darkness comes suddenly, brought by the dark clouds above us. Then, there is a distant loud rumble of thunder. Soon, there is another, combined with a dazing flash of lighting.\n\nAnd another strike, brightly illuminating the area, the afterimage burned into my eyes. I blink and see where the lighting has struck: now, there is a quickly expanding brush fire. And it is spreading toward us!"
 travel_danger_events.3005.a:0 "RUN!"
 travel_danger_events.3005.a.success:0 "We run away from the fire"
