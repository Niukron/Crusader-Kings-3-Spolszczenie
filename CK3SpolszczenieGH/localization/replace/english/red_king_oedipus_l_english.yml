 player_mission.0001.t:0 "Fruitless Efforts"
 player_mission.0001.desc:0 "It seems the world has changed not necessarily to my advantage. How will the world see me if I walk away from my ambitions now?."
 player_mission.0001.a:0 "As a coward. Let us press on!"
 player_mission.0001.b:0 "As wise and caring. Let us reconsider."
 player_mission.1001.t:0 "A United Realm"
 player_mission.1001.desc:0 "I am the rightful ruler of [GetPlayer.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName], yet there are those who oppose my leadership. For the good of the realm, all lawful subjects should be under the same banner."
 player_mission.1001.a:0 "We should stand as one."
 player_mission.1001.b:0 "Let us wait for now."
 player_mission.1002.desc:0 "My lands are united and any rebellious fires have been temporarily quelled. Future rebel rousers or pretenders would do well in not crossing me!"
 player_mission.1002.a:0 "No one shall threaten the stability of my realm."
 player_mission.1011.t:0 "To Die With Dreams"
 player_mission.1011.desc:0 "In my sleep, a single hooded figure stands at the foot of my bed. If he is death, then I am not ready to go! I still have dreams to pursue!"
 player_mission.1011.a:0 "I must not procrastinate."
 player_mission.1011.b:0 "Calm now. I have plenty of time left."
 player_mission.1012.desc:0 "Surely, I have now earned a place in history. Songs and stories will be told of me long after I depart!"
 player_mission.1012.a:0 "At last, I can rest."
 player_mission.1012.b:0 "Do I have time to do more?"
 player_mission.1021.t:0 "Chasing a Crown"
 player_mission.1021.desc:0 "Long have I coveted the crown of the [GetPlayer.GetPrimaryTitle.GetDeJureLiege.GetName] and know that it can be within my reach. A few well played moves, and can make it so. My desire must not make me careless, as a wrong move may ruin me."
 player_mission.1021.a:0 "Let us play!"
 player_mission.1021.b:0 "I will wait for now."
 player_mission.1022.desc:0 "The game is won, though it may not be over. Many are those who look to my crown as a price to take. They will watch my every move and strike whenever I falter."
 player_mission.1022.a:0 "Let us not lose this"
 player_mission.1022.b:0 "It would be foolish to stop now!"
 player_mission.1031.t:0 "The Weight of a Crown"
 player_mission.1031.desc:0 "Some say the weight of a crown is heavy to bear. They must have weak necks! Indeed, my own neck would be more than able to bear the crown of the [GetPlayer.GetPrimaryTitle.GetDeJureLiege.GetName]."
 player_mission.1031.a:0 "I wish to try it on."
 player_mission.1031.b:0 "The one I have already is enough."
 player_mission.1032.desc:0 "No matter how ornate or encrusted the crown, my neck can bear it and still hold my head up high! I feel elevated even, towering above my peers. The insides are rather pointed though."
 player_mission.1032.a:0 "Perhaps I can have it cushioned?"
 player_mission.1041.t:0 "A Shield of Power"
 player_mission.1041.desc:0 "Our world is harsh and full of perils, yet I am tasked with protecting my family and kin. If I were to join the most dangerous game and claim great riches and wealth, could it then not be spent on our defenses?"
 player_mission.1041.a:0 "I have to do it for them!"
 player_mission.1041.b:0 "I will wait for now."
 player_mission.1042.desc:0 "No man has ever claimed success without creating envy. With our new position, my family have the resources to prosper, but also new enemies to fear!"
 player_mission.1042.a:0 "They should be safe now."
 player_mission.1042.b:0 "They are not safe yet."
 player_mission.1051.t:0 "The Greater Good"
 player_mission.1051.desc:0 "My people are lost lambs, and I fear that I must be their shepherd. For I am the drum on which the heavens beat their holy song. Many are the men in power who will stand against me, but I have no choice. I would gladly sacrifice my body to cast down the wicked and bring salvation to the good!"
 player_mission.1051.a:0 "This is not my choice, but my fate!"
 player_mission.1051.b:0 "A warrior must not only be brave, but patient."
 player_mission.1052.desc:0 "Heaven's will has been done! Have I now found my place, or is my task greater still?"
 player_mission.1052.a:0 "Without knowing, I shall not risk to err."
 player_mission.1052.b:0 "My work only ceases with me."
 player_mission.1061.t:0 "Woe to the Weak"
 player_mission.1061.desc:0 "The green lands of Englands have spoiled it's peoples. The anglo-saxons sleep in soft beds and cower behind stone walls. As we prepare our longships and sharpen our axes, they dine in their castles and worry not to muddy their boots. What you can not defend, is not yours to keep"
 player_mission.1061.a:0 "They have lost the right to their lands."
 player_mission.1061.b:0 "I should not underestimate them."
 player_mission.1062.desc:0 "I merely proved my right to rule, yet in my wake, I have left a trail of destruction and misery. The once green and fruitful lands are running red with blood. The villages I am to rule have been starved and burned."
 player_mission.1062.a:0 "I refuse to grow soft. A conqueror conquerors."
 player_mission.1062.b:0 "I am not done yet."
 player_mission.1071.t:0 "Emperor of All Hispania"
 player_mission.1071.desc:0 "Why are my neighbouring rulers in such a disarray and malcontent? So many of them fail to see their way out of darkness, instead focusing on petty squabbles. They all either lack vision, merit, morals or funds. If a handful could be persuaded to join my cause, to see what future I can see, then the rest would follow. Once united, nothing could break us apart!"
 player_mission.1071.a:0 "They all wish for unification, I just have to make it so."
 player_mission.1071.b:0 "I must tread carefully, lest they unite against me."
 player_mission.1072.desc:0 "The peninsula is once again ruled by a single crown, yet I must not be fooled to think it is the only crown still with power. Those who previously fought over scraps have now a common prey to fell."
 player_mission.1072.a:0 "At least my herd is great and strong."
 player_mission.1081.t:0 "Roman Restoration"
 player_mission.1081.desc:0 "Rome lost its status as crown jewel of the Mediterranean long before the fall of the west, yet it's symbolic meaning never waned. The decision to retake the old capital should not be taken lightly, yet one can not restore the old order without it. If I am to undo centuries of chaos and decline, then this path is one I must eventually walk."
 player_mission.1081.a:0 "This die must be cast."
 player_mission.1081.b:0 "I must not gamble away an empire."
 player_mission.1082.desc:0 "After long last, there is cause for a true triumph! Our troops have cast out the squatters of the holy city and are now distributing bread and restoring order. Is this a turning point for civilization, or will it be a mere footnote in the history books?"
 player_mission.1082.a:0 "I will not lose the city again."
 player_mission.1091.t:0 "Ensuring Sanctity"
 player_mission.1091.desc:0 "I can no longer sit idly by as the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorshipPlural] in [holy_site_1.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] gets defaced by heretics! Come morning, I shall gather my most learned men and pious warriors to find a way for it's salvation!"
 player_mission.1091.a:0 "It is the will of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]!"
 player_mission.1091.b:0 "The road is long. We must prepare properly."
 player_mission.1092.desc:0 "I stand in awe at the realization, the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] has been saved! A tear falls down my cheek as I lift my head towards a blue sky. From this day onwards, few men can deny the power of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith]!"
 player_mission.1092.a:0 "I have been blessed to be here."
 player_mission.1101.t:0 "A Place in The Sun"
 player_mission.1101.desc:0 "The road is slippery with mud and wet stone as I trudge my way up from the market. The cold rain is pouring down and finds it's way inside my sweaty tunic. Curse this depressing place! Somewhere in the back of my mind, echoes of far away shores appear. Images of white beaches, fruit trees and exotic beasts fill my head. If paradise worlds such as those do exist, then what am I doing in this bitter place?"
 player_mission.1101.a:0 "It is high time I went on an adventure!"
 player_mission.1101.b:0 "I need to know more of my destination before I leave!"
 player_mission.1102.desc:0 "This truly is a paradise! It is everything I hoped for, but not without its dangers. To keep my spot in this paradise, I must either get along with the locals, or rid us of them."
 player_mission.1102.a:0 "I am exposed as it is, I must make friends."
 player_mission.1102.b:0 "It is too late to play nice now!"
 player_mission.1111.t:0 "Celtic Reclamation"
 player_mission.1111.desc:0 "Our ancestral lands have long been the battleground where foreign cultures wrestle for control. Yet, there is a changing of the winds. Could we live in the age when the invaders are finally dispelled and the natural order is restored?"
 player_mission.1111.a:0 "We are one people!"
 player_mission.1111.b:0 "I should strike when they least suspect."
 player_mission.1112.desc:0 "In the town squares, theatre groups are dramatizing the stories of Finn and the Fianna and the Dlí na Feíne can once again be followed without outside opposition. United and unshackled, we must never allow invaders to land on our shores again."
 player_mission.1112.a:0 "The age of the celts has come!"
 player_mission.1121.t:0 "The Carolingian Crown"
 player_mission.1121.desc:0 "The once great empire of the Carolingians has been shattered by infighting, inheritance and invaders. It would require the strength matching that of Charlemagne himself to bring the empire back together. Do I dare to assume I have such strength within me?"
 player_mission.1121.a:0 "My blood gives me strength!"
 player_mission.1121.b:0 "True strength lies in picking your battles."
 player_mission.1122.desc:0 "I know my forefathers would look proudly upon me today. For I have mended the empire that lesser men broke. I must reforge it stronger than before, lest it will break again."
 player_mission.1122.a:0 "It will take more than a sharp sword to hold our empire together."
