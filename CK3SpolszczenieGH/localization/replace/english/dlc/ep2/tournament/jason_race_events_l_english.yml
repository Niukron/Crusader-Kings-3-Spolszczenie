 jason_race_events.1.desc.rowdy_fans:0 "\n\nThe thrill of the race always draws the worst of the realm, in enormous numbers, and riles them with promises of carousing and gambling. \n\nSometimes, on ill-fated days, the usual pleasures just aren't enough: only blood can satisfy."

 jason_race_events.2.desc:0 "The horses thunder along the track, their coursing bodies obscured by clouds of dust, the cursing and yelling of their jockeys inaudible amidst hoof-beats and the roar of the crowd.\n\nStill, you can tell your rider [jockey.GetFirstName] is utterly focused on a rapidly-approaching turn. As the others slow to take the sharp bend in stride, your rider spurs hard.\n\nWith just a fingers-breadth to spare, [jockey.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and #EMP [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetContestHorseRaceName')]#! slip between those ahead. An incredible maneuver — the crowd gasps as one!"
