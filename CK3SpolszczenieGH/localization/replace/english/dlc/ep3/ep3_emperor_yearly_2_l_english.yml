 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_milan:0 "\n\nOur ancestors named this area [county.GetNameNoTier] from the barbarians who first subtracted it from the Empire, the Longobards. One of its main centers, Mediolanum, was the capital of the Western Part of the Empire under the Tetrarchs, and Constantine the Great issued the Edict granting religious freedom to the whole Empire from this same city.\n\nWhile the Longobards moved their capital away, the area is still prosperous and will make for an excellent stronghold in Northern Italy."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_trier:0 "\n\nNowadays, the locals call this city [county.GetNameNoTier], but we still remember how our people used to call it: Augusta Treverorum, seat of the tetrarch Constantius Chlorus, father of the founder of our New Rome, Constantine the Great.\n\nGermanic invaders have long overtaken it, more recently even fashioning themselves as "Emperors", abusing a title that does not belong to barbarians. It matters no more. As my loyal troops reconquer what once was ours by right, all pretenders will be annihilated, and only one legitimate Empire shall remain."

 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_tours:0 "\n\nNowadays, the locals call this area [county.GetNameNoTier], from the now-forgotten Latin name of its main settlement, Civitas Turonum. In the last days of the Western Part of the Empire, the city was a true metropolis, dominating the whole Province of Lugdunum.\n\nSince then, its importance has only partially diminished, as Christian pilgrims still flock to it on their way to Santiago, and it has acted as a bulwark against two invasions: that of the Arabs, and that of Vikings. True Roman spirit still lingers in these lands, and they will rediscover it whether they like it or not!"
