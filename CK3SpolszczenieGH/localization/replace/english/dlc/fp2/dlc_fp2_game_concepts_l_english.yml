 game_concept_iberian_struggle_desc:0 "The $game_concept_iberian_struggle$ depicts the centuries of fractious relationships on the Iberian Peninsula. Though born of the Umayyad  Conquest of Iberia in the 8th Century, the [struggle|E] shifts between [struggle_phase_phases|E] of hate-fueled violence, wary truces, and pragmatic cooperation. There are few permanent allies in such a situation, and [rulers|E] should be wary of relying purely on a shared [faith|E] or [culture|E]."
